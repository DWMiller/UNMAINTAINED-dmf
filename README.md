A lightweight modular javascript framework.

Founded on the examples provided in this tutorial on modular javascript by Andrew Burgess: http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/writing-modular-javascript--net-14746

Requires jQuery, for now.

I'll add some documentation when I'm satisfied that the remaining levels of stupid have been adequately reduced.
